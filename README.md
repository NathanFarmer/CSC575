# CSC 575 Final Project

An internet connection is requried to download the data and use the UI.

The full dataset was too large to upload here. It should be downloaded by running download_documents.py. On your local machine, the documents will be extracted to a folder called "data/". The .gitignore file tells git to ingore anything in that folder so it does not sync to this repository.

Once the documents are downloaded, you can open the UI in your browser by running "Search Engine UI.exe". This will launch Mongoose web server and open your broswer to index.html. Once you are finished using the UI, you will want to close Mongoose or else it will allow a new instance to run on your machine every time you open it. Mongoose stays open as a "hidden icon" on Windows machines. Right click the blue diamond icon and select exit to close the web server.
